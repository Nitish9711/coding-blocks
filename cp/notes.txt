An Efficient Solution is to observe the pattern. Only those numbers, which are perfect Squares have an odd number of factors. Let us analyze this pattern through an example.

For example, 9 has odd number of factors, 1, 3 and 9. 16 also has odd n
umber of factors, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. The reason for this is, 
for numbers other than perfect squares, all factors are in the form of pairs, 
but for perfect squares, one factor is single and makes the total as odd.
