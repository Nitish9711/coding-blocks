where to apply dp??

1. optimal substructure
2. overlapping subProblems



ways to apply dp
1. top down approach - (recursion + memorization)
2. bottom up approach - iteration  + memorization



Given two strings , what could be the best complexity that you can solve in , the K-ordered LCS of the given strings ?

A k-ordered LCS is defined to be the LCS of two sequences if you are allowed to change at most k elements in the first sequence to any value you wish to.

Defining N and M as the length of the given strings respectively.

O(NklogM)
