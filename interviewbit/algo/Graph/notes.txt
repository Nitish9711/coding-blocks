A graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components: 
1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes. 
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u) in case of 
a directed graph(di-graph). The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v.
 The edges may contain weight/value/cost.
Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications: Graphs are used to represent networks. 
The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, 
Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). 
Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, and locale. See this for more applications of graph. 




complete graph - exactly one edge between each pair of vertices represented by kn
no of edge = n(n-1)/2;

cycle - simple graphs with vertices n >= 3 denoted by Cn 
no of edge = n

wheels  - cycle with one additional vertex which is connected to every other vertex.
Wn
no of edges = 2*(n-1)

hypercube - The Hypercube or n-cube is a graph with 2^n vertices each represented by a n-bit string.
The vertices which differ by at most 1-bit are connected by edges. A hypercube of 2^n vertices is denoted by Q_{n}. 
Total number of edges are n*2^{n-1} with 2^n vertices in cube graph.

Biconnected graph: A connected graph which cannot be broken down into 
any further pieces by deletion of any vertex.It is a graph with no articulation point.

sparse graph - no of edges < vLog V  v is vertices

foreset is disjoint set of trees

number of edges a node can have in a graph
max e : nC2 -> o(n2)
min E: n-1 edges(tree)

ways to represent graph
1. adjancey matrix
2. edges and list 

V = {0, 1, 2, 3}
E = [(0,1)(0, 2)(0, 3) (1, 2) ....]
3. adjancey list
0->1,2
1->2
2->1, 3
...

4. implicit graph
2d matrix



=> distance from source to dest in unweighted graph can be calucluated with bfs
snakes and ladders leetcode

dfs forest - group of connected graphs


dijkistra 
priority queue has not the option to update so we use set for storing distance;



spanning trees
it is a tree made from subset of edges that connects all the vertices of graph i.e graph forms a 
single connected component without forming a cycle contains n-1 edges where n is number of vertices


algo

1. kruskal algorithm (greedy algo)
2. prims' algorithm(greedy algo)

kruskal algo
edge list graph and DSU(disjoint sets union)
wwighted undirected graph
greedy algo
1. sort all the edges on the basisi of their weight
2. pick the edges that does not form a cycle



prims algo
weighted undirected graph
greedy algorithm

TERMS
1. MST set =[] all the nodes that have been implemented in mst till now
2. active edge = edge from a vertex in MST to V;
3. MST edge - AN edge that has been included in MST so far


algo steps
1. start from any source vertex.
2. find the active edges from that source
3. out of all active edges , pick the one with the smallest weight.
    - select Y in MST
    - add edges starting from y in active edge list
    repeat above steps until all vertices are covered



time = O(eloge)
IN FULLY CONNECTED GRAPH THEN 
if e is propotional to v^2 
then
TIME = O(ELOG V)


shortest path algorithms
single source
1. BFS (unweighted graph)  O(V+E)

BFS can only be used to find shortest path in a graph if:

There are no loops

All edges have same weight or no weight.

2. dijkistra    (weighted, positive weighted , directed and undirected both)  O(ELOG V) 

3. BELLMAN         (weighted, negative+positive weight)  O(VE)

dp based algo
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works on directed graphs. 
To make it work with undirected graphs we must make each undirected edge 
into two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same weights as 
the original undirected edge. Now any negative weight undirected cycle is 
transformed into a negative weight directed cycle, and hence would be detected.
 In any negative weight edge is transformed in a negative weight cycle of length two! 
 Thus Bellman-Ford will always detect a negative cycle if there is any negative weight edge.

BELLMAN FORD algorithm
1. INIT DIST[vertices] = INT_MAX , dist[src] = 0
2. Relax all edges V-1 times  [Most Important]
relaxation - dist[u] , dist[v] 
if(dist[v ]> dist[u])+WTuv
    dist[V] = dist[u] + wt



3. negative weight cycle detection



FLOYD WARSHALL algorithm
- all pair shortest path 
- shortest between pair of vertices
- work with negative edges
- can detect negative cycles too, with one extra steps
- dp based algo - > O(n3) n vertices


HAMILTONINA cycle
SET OF EDGES that every node is visited once and we came back to starting node.

output of tsp
min weight HAMILTONINAn cycle
 




graph with n nodes and n-1 edges - tree => no cycle is in the graph


bipartite graph
- you can divide all vertices of graph in 2 sets
- such that all edges of the graph are form set 1 to set2

two coloring 
if the cycle is not present in a graph then it will always be bipartite

if the graph has a cycle of odd nuber of nodes then it will be not bipartite graph




1.strongly connected component(ssc)
subset of graph in which if we start from any node we can reach any other node


Kosaraju's algorithm
1. dfs on graph get an ordering based upon finish time
finish time is define as the time to come back to same node from we started.
2. reverse the orginal graph i.e reverse all the edges of the graph
3. do dfs from r to l as given in ordering list.




some points
If we use trees with the union-by-rank algorithm, 
the worst case running time for checking if two elements are in same set or not O(logN)

Two graphs which contain the same number of graph vertices connected 
in the same way are said to be isomorphic. Formally, two graphs and with graph vertices are said 
to be isomorphic 
if there is a permutation of such that is in the set of graph edges iff is in the set of graph edges .
