// A C++ program to Clone an Undirected Graph
/*The idea is to do a BFS traversal of the graph and while visiting a node make a clone node of it (a copy of original node). 
If a node is encountered which is already visited then it already has a clone node.

How to keep track of the visited/cloned nodes?
A HashMap/Map is required in order to maintain all the nodes which have already been created.
Key stores: Reference/Address of original Node
Value stores: Reference/Address of cloned Node
While visiting the neighboring vertices of a node u get the corresponding cloned node for u , letâ€™s call that cloneNodeU , 
now visit all the neighboring nodes for u and for each neighbor find the corresponding clone node(if not found create one) 
and then push into the neighboring vector of cloneNodeU node.*/
