The number of NULL links (wasted pointers) in a complete binary tree of n nodes are n+1.




If given no. of Nodes are N Then.

Different No. of BST=Catalan(N)
Different No. of Structurally Different Binary trees are = Catalan(N)

Different No. of Binary Trees are=N!*Catalan(N)


Total number of possible Binary Search Trees with n different keys (countBST(n)) = Catalan number Cn = (2n)! / ((n + 1)! * n!)
Total number of possible Binary Trees with n different keys (countBT(n)) = countBST(n) * n!
