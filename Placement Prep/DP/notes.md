# DP
*Those who can't remember their past are condemned to repeat it*

DP questions have two properties:-  
1. Optimal Substructure - if we solve bigger problem by solving the smaller problems then we can say it follows optimal substructure. Bascially an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
2. Overlapping Subproblems - a problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times or a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over rather than always generating new subproblems. 

## Methods
- top down approach - recursion + memorization(dp array)
start on biggest problem

in recursion 
space complexity - extra stack space + normal space we are using


- bottom up approach - start on smallest problem
